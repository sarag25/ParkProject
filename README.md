## Parking Spot Detection and Classification: Assessing Legality and Slot Type Using Deep Learning and Rule-Based Approaches

***From the Abstract*** : Starting from an image of a parking area, first we employ detection to identify single parking spots, then classification to differentiate between occupied and empty spaces; additionally, if a car is present, we classify each slot as either correct or incorrect parking, otherwise we classify the type of empty space like normal, paid, disabled or pregnant parking. We employed mainly neural networks for object detection and classification, but also rule-based approaches.
