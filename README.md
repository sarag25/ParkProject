## Parking Spot Detection and Classification: Assessing Legality and Slot Type Using Deep Learning and Rule-Based Approaches

***From the Abstract*** : Starting from an image of a parking area, first we employ detection to identify single parking spots, then classification to differentiate between occupied and empty spaces; additionally, if a car is present, we classify each slot as either correct or incorrect parking, otherwise we classify the type of empty space like normal, paid, disabled or pregnant parking. We employed mainly neural networks for object detection and classification, but also rule-based approaches.

### How to execute the pipeline
The datasets are not available on this repository but are downloadable here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RHxNd7ZpMgi6An2oUwFgzz-q7toDPgbm?usp=drive_link

The 'ParkProject.py' file can be used to try the full pipeline on a single image; example images can be found in the 'datasets' folder. The outputs generated will be saved in the 'results' folder.

In the pipeline, the files are executed in the following order:
<ul>
  <li>
    'preprocessing'
  </li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
